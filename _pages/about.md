Hello!  My name is Michael LeBeane and I'm a Senior Design Engineer at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/).  I'm also a recent PhD graduate from [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I worked in the [Laboratory for Computer Architecture (LCA)](https://lca.ece.utexas.edu/).

I'm interested in all manner of computing technology.  Recently, I've been doing research in computer networks, GPUs, and simulation frameworks.
